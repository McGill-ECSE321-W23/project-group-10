## Description of Project

This system application is designed for a Parking Lot System.
The parking lot is a five-story building. Each floor can accommodate 100 cars except for the ground floor. The ground floor has the main entrance, 20 spots for large cars, and 50 spots for regular cars. The second and third floors are reserved for monthly customers who pay a flat rate every month. Monthly customers have a specific reserved spot which cannot be used by anyone else. The fourth and fifth floor are open to the public where customers pay in increments of 15 minutes up to a maximum of 12 hours. In addition to parking, the business provides other services such as winter tire change, car cleaning, and oil change.

The parking lot is managed by its owner, who gets their own user account. The lot also has several employees, each of which gets their own account. Lastly, monthly customers can choose to create an account as well. Through their account, the owner can manage and decide on numerous things related to the parking lot: opening hours, employee schedules, fees, hiring/firing employees, etc. Employees, on the other hand, can use their accounts to decide which spot goes to which customer among other things. The manager can do all the tasks that an employee can. The customers use their account to pay their monthly fee or request a services.
